    <h1>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <div>AI in Robotics
        The field of robotics involves the designing and creation of automated machines or robots in such a way that they possess the ability to perform tasks on their own. Nowadays, robots are becoming more and more advanced and efficient in accomplishing tasks. This is due to the Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques that are specially designed for the field of robotics. Advanced robots consist of sensors, high-definition cameras, voice recognition devices, etc.These robots are capable of learning from their past mistakes and experience and can adjust the algorithms according to the environment. Artificial Intelligence is an extremely useful tool for robotic applications. When AI is combined with advanced devices, it can help in optimizations. It is helpful in enhancing the complex manufacturing process in industries such as aerospace. Also, the packaging process in industries that use AI helps enhance productivity and lower the overall cost. 
        AI in Defense
        The defense is one of the most crucial sectors where Artificial Intelligence is contributing to nations. Defense security systems can be vulnerable to get attacked by hackers to steal governmental or defense data. These attackers would do so to sell the information to other nations. This can prove to be detrimental to any country. The manual identification and processing of unusual activities may not detect potential threats and could be time-consuming. This is where the involvement of Artificial Intelligence proves to be of great use.The analysis of large amounts of data becomes easy with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Tools of AI help in finding suspicious activity over the system. AI algorithms are designed in such a way that they try to learn from the data and distinguish between authorized and unauthorized access. Also, they keep track of the safety of the military database. Any alterations in the database by an unknown source is immediately tracked down for action.
        AI in Transport
        Artificial Intelligence in the transport industry has completely changed the era of traveling. As the competition in the travel industry is high, there is a need to analyze all the factors that influence the travel business. These factors are price, seasons, festivals, the number of travelers, etc.You must have noticed that the price of flights in Paytm keep fluctuating often. Reasons for its fluctuation are seasons, festivals, routes, halts, and the number of travelers on the same route. With the help of predictive analytics, the software can analyze data related to these factors that impact the cost of transport. Tools of Artificial Intelligence help perform predictive analytics efficiently on the data. With AI tools, the software or the application can predict the best prices in specific routes. This helps passengers find cheaper tickets. Further, the AI-based application notifies passengers about the rise and drop in prices and about the offers available while booking tickets. Another real-life application of Artificial Intelligence is in online cabs, including Uber and Ola. These applications use Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science to deliver customized services. AI helps them show optimized paths and prices for the rides.
