     <div>Dangers
     Will AI
     impede and downgrade medical professional’s creativity and thinking ability by reducing brain
     usage caused by depending overt
     ly on AI systems? So “Increasing use of automation may exacerbate de
     -skilling of human physicians due to over-reliance, poor understanding, overconfidence, and lack of
     necessary vigilance of an automated clinical workflow”

     . Will there be any use in training doctors whenwe will be able to only train machines which can be operated by the one having the most basic medicaleducation or even none at all? Will we have our own personal machines as our doctor or surgeon whichwill diagnose and/or perform surgery by push of buttons or initializing up a routine as a bot? Whathappens in case machine malfunctions during a lifesaving surgery and we do not have qualified doctorsas they have been replaced by AI? Such example can be extended to many of the vital occupations. Thisbegs the question will AI mistakes surpass professional human mistakes?Automation thus is posing a great risk to educated professionals and their job markets. People may saytechnologies have always created new jobs by taking old jobs, however AI is a unique kind of technologyas AI seeks to mimic human intelligence thereby really threatening worth of human intelligence. Whilehistorically technologies only replaced a very limited aspect of human action AI seeks to replace humanmind itself.Can AI understand implications or hidden assumptions to perfect decision making? Human beings oftendo understand intents, emotions and implied assumptions. These are some of the great essentials inhuman relationship and in many of the vital human activities such as in a court of law or during aninterview for exampleThe AI will create global technological inequality enhancing the already powerful nations more powerfuland making the less developed nations more exploitable. Also, the military industrial complex willbecome even more bold and audacious because AI warfare will save national lives so there will be nomore public discontent against declaration of wars. Tyrannical nations will become more oppressive.Imagine the dominion of Skynet

      except being controlled by the elites. This militarization of AI poses agreat threat against humanity. Militarizing AI objectives by training machines to do harm and/orpreserve a certain political and strategic policy seems like a sci-fi movie becoming reality.Faulty, inadequately trained, poorly understood algorithms, data poisoning and incorrect statisticalapproximation can produce erroneous results, which may have wide-
     scale impact on people’s lives.
      Takethe example of Tesla self-driving cars which have failed and caused fatalities. For example, an AI systemwas fooled into deciding that
     “stop sign”
      
     had a “speed limit of 45”
     5
     . This could be disastrous for self-driving cars.Also, such faults may have a national and/or global impact if the military industrial complex automates adistributed armed surveillance system. Depending on the design of such a system, which may self-learn,identify and execute its own objectives and depending on the severity and scope of arming maydetermine the danger level to human society.The danger of AI rises also from increasing development of quantum computing, mass and distributedapplication of digital components and extensive digitization process made possible by affordable andcost-effective technologies partly due to cheap labor in some of the cruelest nations and regions onearth. These increase the use and hence the probability of AI harms.Lastly, AI may bring about a revolution in perfecting human apathy. We are today already socially andemotionally isolated by being glued to digital devices, sometimes totally unaware of human diasporaaround the world. With the advent of emotionally acting robots, human beings will become moredistant and this will increase human apathy across societies and regions causing a demise and slowdown in human centric policies.></div><br>
